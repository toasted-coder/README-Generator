## Description
This project is designed to help the user with putting together a README file that looks professional. It's fairly easy to use and will save time when writing READEME files in future projects.

## Installation
Simple enough, using the terminal the user will navigate to the directory they want their README to be in. Once in that directory the user can run npm i to install node modules.

## Usage
As far as usage goes, in the terminal user will type node index.js. This will start the README Generator, from there it's a simple matter of answering the prompted questions. As for the generator itself, use it whenever you start a new repository that needs a README.
